## Workshop Description

Recently, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA’s) Pan-Cancer Atlas initiative presented a comprehensive collection of 27 studies
covering 11,000 patient tumors from 33 cancer types. These studies investigated cancer complexity from different angles by integrating multi -omics and clinical data. In particular, computational analyses have led to the identification of 299 cancer-driver genes and over 3,400 driver mutations. However, it still remains critical to clarify the consequences of each alteration and the underlying biological effects. 
We will discuss several computational tools that are useful in clarifying gene functions when performing integrative analysis of multi-omics datasets. In order to deal with the challenges of data retrieval and integration, TCGAbiolinks (Colaprico et al. 2018, PMID: 26704973) and DeepBlueR (Albrecht et al., 2017, PMID: 28334349) were developed to retrieve data from TCGA, CPTAC, GTEx, GEO and IHEC, Blueprint, ENCODE, Roadmap, respectively. 
Tumor-specific cancer-driver-gene events and downstream impact can be elucidated by integrative analyses of these datasets using MoonlightR (Colaprico et al. 2018).
TCGAbiolinks and MoolightR have been used successfully in multiple studies for oncogenic
processes identification (Ding et al., 2018, PMID: 29625049), oncogenic clinically actionable driver genes discovery (Bailey et al., 2018, PMID: 29625053), and comprehensive immune landscape characterization (Thorsson et al., 2018, PMID: 29628290)


## Workshop: overview 
In this workshop we will demonstrate the capability of TCGAbiolinks, deepblueR and MoonlightR for (1) retrieving -omics data from different consortia (TCGA, GTEx, GEO and IHEC);  (2) discovering cancer driver genes by integrating multi-omics datasets; (3) Identifying the six immune subtypes from TCGA PanCancer dataset and (4) Estimating stemness scores using gene expression data. 
Our goal is for the end users to understand how biological features (Immune Subtypes, Oncogenic Processes, Driver Genes and Stemness) can be used to expand understating of their own datasets.  


```{r, eval= FALSE, echo = FALSE,hide=TRUE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
devtools::load_all(".")
```

The packages we need for this session are
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(SummarizedExperiment)
library(dplyr)
library(Bioc2019PanCancerStudy)
```

## Data retrieval from (GDC-TCGA, GEO and IHEC)
Using TCGAbiolinks, you can easily query, download, and prepare multi-omics data from NCI’s Genomic Data Commons (GDC). The GDC provides the cancer research community with a unified data repository that enables data sharing across cancer genomic studies in support of precision medicine. The GDC supports several cancer genome programs at the NCI Center for Cancer Genomics (CCG), including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET). [https://gdc.cancer.gov/]

```{r load_TCGA, message=FALSE}
library(TCGAbiolinks)
```

We will illustrate retrieval of different types of –omics datasets including: 1. Gene expression 2. Copy number 3. Protein expression (RRPA) 4. Methylation 5. Clinical data 6. microRNA expression 7. Mutation 8. Chromatin Accessibility

### `TCGA Gene Expression` (IlluminaHiSeq_RNASeqV2) and multi -omics data 
The end user can search TCGA's samples for a specific cancer of origin, download and prepare a matrix of gene expression. This code is an example; we provide the output of this code in this workshop package (see below).
```{r, eval = FALSE}
cancerType <- "BRCA"

# Query platform Illumina HiSeq with a list of barcode 
query <- GDCquery(
  project = paste0("TCGA-",cancerType),
  data.category = "Gene expression",
  data.type = "Gene expression quantification",
  experimental.strategy = "RNA-Seq",
  platform = "Illumina HiSeq",
  file.type = "results",
  legacy = TRUE
)
# 38 seconds on GO's machine

# We select 10 tumor and 10 normal samples
Sample_sel <- query$results[[1]]$cases

# TP is Primary Tumor
# NT is Solid Tissue Normal

Sample_sel_TP <- TCGAquery_SampleTypes(barcode = Sample_sel,typesample = "TP")
Sample_sel_NT <- TCGAquery_SampleTypes(barcode = Sample_sel,typesample = "NT")                               

Sample_sel_short <- c(Sample_sel_TP[1:10], Sample_sel_NT[1:10])

# we need to create a new query with the selected barcodes
system.time(
query_down <- GDCquery(
  project = paste0("TCGA-",cancerType),
  data.category = "Gene expression",
  data.type = "Gene expression quantification",
  experimental.strategy = "RNA-Seq",
  platform = "Illumina HiSeq",
  file.type = "results",
  barcode = Sample_sel_short,
  legacy = TRUE
)
# 44.30 seconds on GO's machine
)
```

Now that we have defined the query, we can download the respective data. Makse sure you have a directory to save this data defined beforehand. The data will be downloaded to the folder `TCGA-BRCA` (the first value of `query_down$project`) as a subdirectory of the data directory specified. In addition to downloading the data, this function will write a file called "MANIFEST.txt" to your current *working directory*, not to the directory you specify.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# DataDir is a directory to save your datasets
DataDir <- "TCGAanalysis"

# Download a list of barcodes with platform IlluminaHiSeq_RNASeqV2
GDCdownload(query_down, directory = DataDir)

# Prepare expression matrix with geneID in the rows and samples (barcode) in the columns
# rsem.genes.results as values
BRCARnaseqSE <- GDCprepare(query_down, directory = DataDir)
```


Next, the `TCGAanalyze_Preprocessing()` function performs Array-Array Intensity correlation (AAIC). It defines a square symmetric matrix of Spearman correlations among samples. According this matrix and boxplot of correlation samples by samples it is possible to find samples with low correlation that can be identified as possible outliers. The `cor.cut` controls the correlation threshold to filter out outliers with correlation lower than the threshold. (Rather than require that you execute the above code, we have included the output as the `BRCARnaseqSE` object.)
```{r }
data("BRCARnaseqSE")

dataPrep <- TCGAanalyze_Preprocessing(
  BRCARnaseqSE, cor.cut = 0.6
)

dataNorm <- TCGAanalyze_Normalization(
  tabDF = dataPrep,
  geneInfo = geneInfo,
  method = "gcContent"
) 
```

Now that we have preprocessed and normalized our data, we will inspect the sample boxplots.
```{r}
colnames(dataPrep) <- substr(colnames(dataPrep), 1, 15)
colnames(dataNorm) <- substr(colnames(dataNorm), 1, 15)

par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
boxplot(dataPrep, outline = FALSE, las = 2)
boxplot(dataNorm, outline = FALSE, las = 2)
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

TCGAanalyze_Filtering allows the user to filter genes selecting a threshold. For istance returns all mRNA with mean across all samples, higher than the threshold defined as quantile mean across all samples.
```{r}
dataFilt <- TCGAanalyze_Filtering(
  tabDF = dataNorm,
  method = "quantile", 
  qnt.cut =  0.25
)  
```

The result is shown below:

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE,size = 8}
dataGE <- dataBRCA[sample(rownames(dataBRCA),10),sample(colnames(dataBRCA),7)]

knitr::kable(dataGE[1:10,2:3], digits = 2, 
             caption = "Example of a matrix of gene expression (10 genes in rows and 2 samples in columns)",
             row.names = TRUE)
```

The result from TCGAanalyze_Preprocessing and TCGAanalyze_Normalization is shown below:
```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
include_graphics(file.path(FiguresPath, "TCGA_BRCA_dataPrep_Norm_boxplot.png"))
```

To retrieve other datatypes using TCGAbiolinks it is possible to follow the example for gene expression but replacing the parameters as shown in the following table:

### `GTEx gene expression` data
The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project is an ongoing effort to build a comprehensive public resource to study tissue-specific gene expression and regulation. Samples were collected from 53 non-diseased tissue sites across nearly 1000 individuals, primarily for molecular assays including WGS, WES, and RNA-Seq. [https://gtexportal.org/home/]
You can easily search GTEx samples, download and prepare a matrix of gene expression [RNA-Seq].

### `IHEC gene expression` data
The International Human Epigenome Consortium (IHEC) is a global consortium with the primary goal of providing free access to high-resolution reference human epigenome maps for normal and disease cell types to the research community. [http://ihec-epigenomes.org/] 
IHEC provides data currently available from the following consortia:
* AMED-CREST (Japan)
* Blueprint (Europe)
* CEEHRC (Canada)
* DEEP (Germany)
* ENCODE (USA)
* GIS (Singapore)
* KNIH (South Korea)
* Roadmap (USA)
 
Within IHEC, the BLUEPRINT consortium has been formed with the aim to further the understanding of how genes are activated or repressed in both healthy and diseased human cells. Specifically, BLUEPRINT includes data on distinct types of haematopoietic cells from healthy individuals and their malignant leukaemic counterparts.

```{r pack_load_DeepBlue}

### `GEO gene expression` dataset
GEO Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) is the public repository for high throughput data at NCBI. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/] Here we show how to retrieve GEOs’ samples, download and prepare a matrix of gene expression. In particular to retrieve the gene expression matrix for different cell types from Nazor et al. (2012, PMID: 22560082).

## Oncogenic processes and driver genes using MoonlightR
### MoonlightR overview
In this section, we illustrate the moonlightR analysis pipeline using the BRCA data we downloaded from previous section. In order to make light of cancer development, it is crucial to identify the genes involved in the disease mechanisms and moreover understand what functional roles it plays. Common biological processes such as proliferation and apoptosis have been linked to cancer progression. MoonlightR is a new approach to define tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) and oncogenes (OCGs) based on functional enrichment analysis, inference of gene regulatory networks and upstream regulator analysis to score the importance of well-known biological processes with respect to the studied cancer. 

In the MoonlightR pipeline, first, based on expression data we perform functional enrichment analysis, infer gene regulatory networks and upstream regulator analysis to score the importance of well-known biological processes with respect to the studied cancer. We then use these scores to predict two specific roles for genes: genes that act as TSGs and genes that act as OCGs. This methodology not only allows us to identify genes with dual roles (TSG in one cancer type and OCG in another) but also to elucidate the underlying biological processes they are involved with.

```{r package_load_moonlight}
library(MoonlightR)
```

### MoonlightR pipeline
Here we describe two Moonlight approaches: Moonlight-EB (expert based) and Moonlight-ML (machine learning). The EB and ML approaches share the following three initial steps (Fig 1b, Methods): 
*(i) DPA: Moonlight identifies a set of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) between two conditions;  
*(ii) GRN: The gene expression data is used to infer a Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) with the DEGs as vertices and 
*(iii) FEA: using Functional Enrichment Analysis (FEA), Moonlight considers a DEG in a biological system and quantifies the DEG-BP (biological process) association with a Moonlight Z-score. 
*(iv) URA/PRA:  Finally, we input DEGs and their GRN to Upstream Regulatory Analysis (URA), yielding upstream regulators of BPs mediated by the DEG and its targets. The second part of the pipeline’s tool provides Pattern Recognition Analysis (PRA) that incorporates two approaches. 

In the first approach, PRA takes in two objects: (i) URA’s output and (ii) selection of a subset of the BP provided by the end-user. In contrast, if the BPs are not provided, their selection is automated by a ML method (e.g. random forest model) trained on gold standard oncogenes (OCG) and tumor-suppressor genes (TSG) in the second approach. In addition, dynamic recognition analysis (DRA) detects multiple patterns of BPs when different conditions are selected.

Moonlight’s pipeline is shown below::
```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}

```

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
include_graphics(file.path(FiguresPath, "Moonlight_pipeline2.png"))
```


### `DPA`: Differential Phenotype Analysis
Differential phenotype analysis (DPA) identifies genes or probes that are significantly different between two phenotypes such as normal vs. tumor, or normal vs. stage I, normal vs. a particular molecular subtype.
For gene expression data, DPA performes a differential expression analysis (DEA) to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the `TCGAanalyze_DEA` function from \Biocpkg{TCGAbiolinks}.
For methylation data, DPA is performes a differentially methylated probes analysis (DMP) to identify differentially methylated CpG sites using the `TCGAanalyze_DMR` function from \Biocpkg{TCGAbiolinks}.

For the following example we will use a dataset of breast cancer samples TCGA BRCA (10 TP tumor samples and 10 NT normal samples) previously downloaded and included in \Biocpkg{MoonlightR} package.

```{r, eval = FALSE, message=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE}
# dataFilt is a gene expression dataset with lowly expressed genes filtered out
# dataFilt can be generated following the previous section
# TCGA Gene Expression` (IlluminaHiSeq_RNASeqV2) and multi -omics data

dataBRCA <- data("dataFilt")

dataDEGs <- DPA(dataFilt = dataBRCA,
                dataType = "Gene expression",
                fdr.cut = 0.05,
                logFC.cut = 0)
```

We can visualize those differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with a volcano plot using the `TCGAVisualize_volcano` function.

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
TCGAVisualize_volcano(
  dataDEGs$logFC, dataDEGs$FDR,
  filename = "DEGs_volcano.png",
  x.cut = 1, y.cut = 0.01,
  names = rownames(dataDEGs),
  color = c("black","red","dodgerblue3"),
  names.size = 2,
  show.names = "highlighted",
  highlight = c("SPINK4","INSL4"),
  xlab = " Gene expression fold change (Log2)",
  legend = "State",
  title = "Volcano plot (Normal NT vs Tumor TP)",
  width = 10
)
```

The figure generated by the code above is shown below:
```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center",hide=TRUE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
include_graphics(file.path(FiguresPath, "DEGs_volcano.png"))
```


### `FEA`: Functional Enrichment Analysis
The function FEA performs a functional enrichment analysis using Fisher’s exact test, which identifies gene sets that are significantly enriched with differentially expressed genes. The steps of FEA involve (i) evaluating if DEGs are involved in a biologlical process(BP) through an assessment of the overlap between the list of DEGs and genes relevant to this BP determined by literature mining and (ii) detecting the BPs over-represented by DEGs using Fisher Exact Test. 
In the following, we considered BPs over-represented by genes with  |Moonlight-score| >=1 and FDR <= 0.01. (See Methodology in https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/265322v1.article-info)

In each BP we defined a Moonlight Z-score as the ratio between the sum of all predicted effects (according literature mining) for all the gene
involved in the specific BP and the square-root of the number of all genes. 
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, results='hide'}
data(DEGsmatrix, package = "MoonlightR")
dataFEA <- FEA(DEGsmatrix = DEGsmatrix)
dataFEA <- cbind(dataFEA, FDR = p.adjust(dataFEA$p.Value,method = "fdr") )
dataFEA_filt <- dataFEA[dataFEA$FDR < 0.01,]
```

The output can be visualized with a FEA plot (Functional Enrichment Analysis Plot)

The user can plot the result of a functional enrichment analysis using the function `plotFEA`. A negative z-score indicates that the process' activity is decreased.  A positive z-score indicates that the process' activity is increased. 
Enrichment Analysis showing the BPs enriched significantly with |Moonlight Z-score| >=1 and FDR <= 0.01; increased levels are reported in yellow, decreased in purple, and green shows the -logFDR / 10. A negative Z-score indicates that the process’ activity is decreased while a positive Z-score indicates that the process’ activity is increased. Values in parentheses indicate the number of genes in common between the genes annotated in the biological process and the genes used as input for the functional enrichment.


```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE}
plotFEA(
  dataFEA = dataFEA_filt,
  topBP = nrow(dataFEA_filt),
  additionalFilename = "_BRCA_DEGs", 
  height = 10, 
  width = 10
)
```

The figure generated by the above code is shown below:
```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center",hide=TRUE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
include_graphics(file.path(FiguresPath, "FEAplot.png"))
```


### `GRN`: Gene Regulatory Network
Next, the GRN function perform a gene regulatory network analysis to identify genes regulated by each DEG. In this function,  considering only tumor samples,  we calculate the pairwise mutual information between the DEGs and genes in dataFilt matrix (see previous section) . Afterwards, DEGs’ regulon, representing the genes regulated by a DEG, are defined by filtering out non-significant (p-value > 0.05) interactions using a permutation test (nboot = 100, nGenesPerm = 1000) and thus obtaining a set of regulated genes for each DEG. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# this will take a long time with nboot = 100 and nGenesPerm = 1000, so output
#   is saved in dataGRN. To make this toy example faster, we illustrate with a
#   smaller dataset and 10 permutations and 10 bootstrap samples 

system.time(
dataGRN <- GRN(
  TFs = rownames(DEGsmatrix)[1:100], 
  normCounts = dataFilt,
  nGenesPerm = 10,
  kNearest = 3,
  nBoot = 10
)
)
# 14.14 seconds for the first 100 with 10 perms and nBoot = 10
#  9.21 minutes for all 3390 with 10 perms and nBoot = 10
```

Rather than estimate this gene regulatory network yourself, a subset of this object is included in the Moonlight package (the first 9 genes, rather than all 3390).
```{r}
data("dataGRN", package = "MoonlightR")
```


### `URA`: Upstream Regulator Analysis
The user can also perform upstream regulator analysis using the function `URA`. This function is applied to each DEG in the enriched gene set and its neighbors in the GRN.
This function returns a table yielding upstream regulators of BPs mediated by the DEG and its targets, providing a score between DEG-BP.

```{r}

#BPselected <- dataFEA$Diseases.or.Functions.Annotation[1:5]
BPselected <- c("apoptosis","proliferation of cells")

dataURA <- URA(dataGRN = dataGRN,
               DEGsmatrix = DEGsmatrix,
               BPname = BPselected, 
               nCores = 1)
# 25.35 seconds

head(dataURA)
```

### `PRA`: Pattern Recognition Analysis
`PRA`  allows for the identification of a list of TSGs and OCGs when a list of BPs such as apoptosis and proliferation are provided. Alternatively, we can also classify genes as OCGs or TSGs using a Random Forest based classifier trained on validated cancer driver genes (TSGs and OCGs). More specifically, we define a pattern for which the group of genes classified as OCGs share similar BP as apoptosis (DOWN) and proliferation (UP) while genes classified as TSGs share apoptosis (UP) and proliferation (DOWN).
Once we have a table of gene scores for each BP from URA, we can incorporate the prior biological information to filter out genes with discordant biological effects. For example, it is known that apoptosis and proliferation of cells are opposite biological effects in tumor growth, so the A2M gene (with positive scores in both BPs) should be excluded.
Pattern Recognition Analysis (PRA) combines information from the BPs with the output from URA, as shown in the next example:

The input of the PRA’s function is the output from URA’s function and the list of biological processes(BPs) selected. The output is shown in the following example. The Moonlight package includes this URA output for the first 100 genes (alphabetically).
```{r, eval = TRUE}
data(dataURA)

dataDual <- PRA(
  dataURA = dataURA,
  BPname = c("apoptosis","proliferation of cells"),
  thres.role = 0
)

# Tumour-suppressors
dataDual$TSG 

# Oncogenes
head(dataDual$OCG)
```

These scores are computed as average of absolute values from scores of each BP.

Also, the user can plot the result of a Upstream Regulatory Analysis using the function `plotURA`.
```{r}
TSGs_genes <- names(dataDual$TSG)
OCGs_genes <- names(dataDual$OCG)

plotURA(dataURA = dataURA[c(TSGs_genes, OCGs_genes), ])
```

The figure generated by the above code is shown below. This heatmap shows Moonlight Z-score for upstream regulators in BRCA. Row colors: red indicates increasing and blue decreasing Moonlight Z-scores. OCGs, such as ABCA3, ABCG1, and ABCG2, share similar BP as apoptosis (DOWN) and proliferation (UP); Genes classified as TSGs (ACN9, ADCK5, AFAP1L1) share apoptosis (UP) and proliferation (DOWN).
```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center",hide=TRUE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
include_graphics(file.path(FiguresPath, "URAplot.png"))
```

The table to show the result from PRA and URA is shown below:

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE,size = 8}
dataTSG_OCG <- dataURA[c(names(dataDual$TSG[1:3]), names(dataDual$OCG[1:3])), ]

knitr::kable(dataTSG_OCG, digits = 2, 
             caption = "Example of a dataURA output with TSGs and OCGs patterns",
             row.names = TRUE)
```


### Moonlight PanCancer Study (18 tumor types)
The goal of this study was to characterize intertumoral (between tumors) genomic epigenomic and transcriptomic heterogeneity in cancer tissue by identifying dual role genes. More specifically, we used the expression levels of genes in all the samples obtained from TCGA - GDC with IlluminaHiSeq RNASeqV2 in 18 normal tissues and 18 cancer tissues according to the TCGA criteria.We applied the complete Moonlight pipeline (FEA-URA-PRA) to extract those genes that were significantly increasing or decreasing biological processes such as proliferation of cells and apoptosis. The figure below shows the results of the moonlight pipeline that can be visualized with a circos plot, using the function `plotCircos` from \Biocpkg{MoonlightR}. For further examples see the \Biocpkg{MoonlightR} ’s vignette
http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MoonlightR.html

## Immune subtypes from Thorsson et al. (2018, PMID: 29628290)
Thorsson et al. performed an extensive immunogenomic analysis of more than 10,000 tumors comprising 33 diverse cancer types by utilizing data compiled by TCGA. In this section we illustrate identifying Immune subtypes for TCGA and GEO tumor samples. Figure1C is from Thorsson et al. (2018, PMID: 29628290), which summarizes features of six different immune subtypes.

```{r, fig.width=10, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
include_graphics(file.path(FiguresPath, "ImmuneSubtypes_workflow.png"))
```

Across cancer types, we previously identified six immune subtypes—wound healing, IFN-\gamma dominant, inflammatory, lymphocyte depleted, immunologically quiet, and TGF-\beta dominant, which are characterized by differences in macrophage or lymphocyte signatures, Th1:Th2 cell ratio, extent of intratumoral heterogeneity, aneuploidy, extent of neoantigen load, overall cell proliferation, expression of immunomodulatory genes, and prognosis.

### Survival analysis of TCGA KIRC samples with Immune Subtypes
In the following example we first retrieve the TCGA Immune Subtypes for KIRC (Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma) from Table S1 in Thorsson et al. (2018, PMID: 29628290), next we will run a Kaplan-Meier Overall Survival Analysis for these different Immune Subtypes.

ImmuneSubtypes <- ImmuneSubtypes[ImmuneSubtypes$`Immune Subtype`!="NA",]

dataClin_KIRC <- GDCquery_clinic(project = "TCGA-KIRC",type = "clinical")

dataClin_merged <- merge(
  x = dataClin_KIRC,

## Stemness Analysis

### Stemness overview
Stemness, defined as the potential for self-renewal and differentiation from the cell of origin, was originally attributed to normal stem cells that possess the ability to give rise to all cell types in the adult organism. Cancer progression involves gradual loss of a differentiated phenotype and acquisition of progenitor-like, stem-cell-like features. Undifferentiated primary tumors are more likely to result in cancer cell spread to distant organs, causing disease progression and poor prognosis, particularly because metastases are usually resistant to available therapies
The Overall methodology for Development and Validation of the Stemness Indices from Malta et al. (2018, PMID: 29625051) is shown below:


```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
include_graphics(file.path(FiguresPath, "stemness_methodology.png"))
```

First, we defined a stemness signatures to quantify stemness using publicly available molecular profiles from normal cell types that exhibit various degrees of stemness. More specifically, we derived stemness signatures using an innovative one-class logistic regression (OCLR) machine-learning algorithm (Sokolov et al., 2016, PMID: 26776204) trained on stem cell (ESC, embryonic stemcell; iPSC, induced pluripotent stem cell) classes from NHLBI Progenitor Cell Biology Consortium (PCBC) dataset (Salomonis et al. 2018, PMID: 27293150). In this way we obtained the stemness signature contained in the vector `PCBC_stemSig` in the \Biocpkg{TCGAbiolinks package}, where for each gene we have an estimted weight, based on output from the OCLR’s algorithm.

Next, once the signature is obtained, it can be applied to score new samples. For RNA expression data, we computed Spearman correlations between the model’s weight vector PCBC_stemSig and the new sample’s expression profile. These are the stemness indices for gene expression(mRNAsi) , with scores ranging from 0 to 1, where 1 corresponds to more stemness, less differentiated and 0 corresponds to less stemness but more differentiated.

Stemness Highlights:

1. Epigenetic and expression-based stemness indices measure oncogenic dedifferentiation
2. Immune microenvironment content and PD-L1 levels associate with stemness indices
3. Stemness index is increased in metastatic tumors and reveals intratumor heterogeneity
4. Applying stemness indices reveals potential drug targets for anti-cancer therapies

In the following subsection we will illustrate the methodology used in Malta et al. (2018, PMID: 29625051) for (i) validating the stemness signature trained on PCBC’s dataset in two external datasets (Nazor, IHEC) (ii) deriving the stemness score for TCGA BRCA and LGG-GBM samples, with association to molecular subtypes and survival outcomes.

The result from TCGAanalyze_Stemness validation in IHEC's Dataset is shown below.
In particular we observed that classes more pluripotent such as hematopoietic stem cell, erythroblast showed higher Stemness score whereas classes more differentiate and matures such as monocyte, mature neutrophil and macrophage showed lower Stemness score.
